###Data Description: 
This dataset contains information about used cars. It contains over 8128 observations. This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression. The columns in the given dataset are as follows: name, year, selling_price, km_driven, fuel, seller_type, transmission, owner. 
With the increase in car market, buying and selling of cars is increasing rapidly and that brings us to a door where many people are buying and selling the cars in the market, so to make this process more fluid and with a better market view, we are proposing a model which will take information related to the car and will predict the selling price. This will help to get a better idea on buying and selling cars. 

###Task: We are predicting the selling price of the car based on various features of the cars. 

###SMART Questions: 
1. Variation in the selling price of cars by: 
● Fuel type (diesel, CNG, LPG, petrol) 
● Seller type (dealer, individual, trustmark dealer) 
● Model year (1983-2020) 
● Number of previous owners (1-4) 
● Transmission type (automatic, manual) 
● Number of seats in the car 
● Kilometers driven 
2. Type of car that has been sold the most (in each category) and the prefered category in each variable mentioned above. 
3. Calculate correlation between the selling price and all the remaining variables 4. Build a model to predict the selling price based on the variables (Feature selection, Linear regression model, Principal component analysis and Principal component regression)
